# Alternative Spotify

This project aimed to recreate a Spotify like application.

## Tech Stack

- **VueJS**: I had never used it before this project and I loved the templating, as I first learnt ReactJS, VueJS feels more 'simple' in a good way.
- **TypeScript**: I had used it before but only for basic typing, I had never typed whole objects like an API response. And I now understand why TypeScript is so appreciated in the JavaScript world :satisfied:
- **TailwindCSS**: I had never used it before, so I had to discover all the classes to style my application but I liked to use it, I think it can really help save time once you know the basic classes and the syntax.
